        <h2>Who Am I</h2>
        <p>These are the few questions I ask myself everyday. Thus far ive spent me time dabbling in few areas for work. Whether the reasurant industry, modeling, sales and even working for myself, the same outcome persists. I dont feel fulfilled. So, what next?</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>New York</li>
          <li>&#9992;</li>
          <li>World</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'm from a small town in NY. Over here deer are my neighbors and the racoons love to rumage through the trash. Luckily NYC is only a train ride away. Along these city adventures I found joy in discovering new sights and people. I am amazed by the beauty the world offers and curious as to what lies ahead.</p>
